prettier does move around some comments, see language-js/comments.js
some comments are printed into the doc tree, some are not

// ends up in doc tree
if (true) {
  return; // is not in doc tree?
}

--debug-print-doc shows their debug print
_docPrinter.js can be used to write tests

run configurations can be used for format _scratch.x files, this allows debugging, and they are set up
to spit out the doc tree into files.
prettier-java requires some extra setup see src/languages.js
